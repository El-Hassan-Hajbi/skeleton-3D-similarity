- [ ] Transform the segmented MS into a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
- [ ] Create a graph database from CAD dataset.

# Voxelized 3D model

Under the assumption that the initial model is given in triangulated form, we begin by scaling all the vertices so that they fall within a rectangular lattice of fixed dimension and resolution. We then sub-divide each triangle to generate a dense intersection with this lattice, resulting in a binary (voxelized) 3-D model.

# AOF and topology preserving thining process

The average outward flux of the Euclidean distance functionâ€™s gradient vector field is computed through unit spheres centered at each rectangular lattice point, using Algorithm 1. This quantity has the property that it approaches a negative number at skeletal points and goes to zero elsewhere, and thus can be used to drive a digital thinning process, for which an efficient implementation is described in Algorithm 2. This thinning process has to be imple- mented with some care, so that the topology of the object is not changed. This is done by identifying each simple or removable point x.
