# skeleton-3D-similarity
Implementation of 3D similarity based on skeleton and graph representation from this paper : "Retrieving Articulated 3-D Models Using Medial Surfaces and Their Graph Spectra"


# Tasks 
- [ ] Find 26-neighborhood of a given point and visualise it. Evaluate its complexity.
- [ ] For a given set of discrete voxels, calculate the number of its connected components (adjacent = 26-neighbors for example). Evaluate its complexity.
- [ ] Calculate C*, and visualise all surface points. Evaluate its complexity.
